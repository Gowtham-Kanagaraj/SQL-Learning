In computing, a database is an organized collection of  structured information or data stored and accessed electronically in a computer system.

A database is a collection of organized data stored and accessed electronically. It allows users to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. An example of a database is a phone book, which stores phone numbers and other contact information. In a phone book, the phone numbers are organized by last name, and you can look up a person's phone number by searching for their name. Similarly, databases allow users to search for and retrieve specific pieces of information within a larger collection of data.

There are many different types of databases, including relational databases, which store data in tables with rows and columns, and NoSQL databases, which store data in a more flexible and scalable way.

Databases are used in a wide variety of applications, including e-commerce websites, customer relationship management systems, and online libraries. They allow businesses and organizations to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently and effectively.

There are many different types of data that can be stored in a database, including: 
1. Textual data, such as names, addresses, and descriptions

2. Numeric data, such as prices, quantities, and measurements
3. Dates and times
4. Binary data, such as images, audio files, and documents
5. Links to other pieces of data or to external resources

A database can store any type of data as long as it is organized in a structured way that allows the database to process and retrieve the data efficiently.
